Variable block times

The idea is to have a new rule on valid blocks - They must use up-to the block gas limit (+/- 1% of the block gas limit) in order to be considered valid.

This requires that we have variable target block times. 

How to chose the next block difficulty? 
Difficulty remains static. We arbitrarily choose a block difficulty, and it's not longer used as a way to keep the block times consistent.

How to chose the next block time?
Time no longer matters for calculating difficulty - there is no target block time anymore.
