### Simple Summary

Enable the outstanding Ethereum Foundation _Constaninople_ and _Petersburg_ EVM opcode upgrades, while also introducing a _Generalized Account Versioning Scheme_ for the EVM. 

These changes would be made on the Ethereum Classic network in a hard-fork code-named _Agharta_ to enable maximum compatibility across EVM-based networks and to ensure backwards-compatiblity for existing contracts across hardforks modifying VM rules.

### Abstract

Add support for a subset of protocol-impacting changes introduced in the Ethereum Foundation (ETH) network via the
_Constaninople_ and _Petersburg_ hardforks. The proposed changes for Ethereum Classic's _Agharta_ upgrade include the following opcode introductions:

- Constantinople bitwise shifting instructions
- Constantinople skinny `CREATE2` opcode
- Constantinople `EXTCODEHASH` opcode

Further, add support for:
 - Generalized Account Versioning [EIP-1702: Generalized Account Versioning Scheme](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1702), which "defines a method of hard forking while maintaining the exact functionality of existing account by allowing multiple versions of the virtual machines to execute in the same block."
 
 
#### Schedule

This document proposes the following blocks at which to implement these changes in the Classic networks:

- Morden Testnet (_deprecated_), Dec 11, 2019, 12pm UTC, block `5_348_435` (Gethc, Parity)
- Mordor Testnet, Jan 15, 2020, 12pm UTC, block `617_716` (Gethc, Parity, Mgeth)
- Kotti Testnet, Feb 05, 2020, 12pm UTC, block `2_028_202` (Parity, Mgeth)
- Classic Mainnet, Apr 15, 2020, 12pm UTC, _no block number required yet_

For more information on the opcodes and their respective EIPs and implementations, please see the _Specification_
section of this document.

### Motivations

- To enhance the Ethereum Virtual Machine's (EVM) capabilities in order to maintain congruence with ETH, which has implemented these opcodes since early 2019. (EIP-145, EIP-1014, EIP-1052)
- To allow "breaking features to be implemented while making sure existing contracts work as expected." (EIP-1702)

### Specification

Enable the following four hard fork features: 

- [EIP-1702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1702) Generalized Account Versioning; see "Specification" section (commonly known as EIP-1702 variant I)
  + Determine a new account version `0x1`, as specified in link above, and detailed in paragraph below.
- [EIP 145](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-145) (Bitwise shifting instructions)
- [EIP 1014](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1014) (Skinny `CREATE2` opcode)
- [EIP 1052](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1052) (`EXTCODEHASH` opcode)


Specifically with definition from __EIP-1702 "Usage Template"__ section:

- **Version**: `0x1`.
- **Parent version**: `0x0`.
- **Features**: EIP 145, EIP 1014 and EIP 1052.

### Rationale

__Atomicity__: This protocol specification notably merges the scheduled features of the anticipated _Petersburg_
protocol upgrade, which would removes the buggy proposal `SSTORE` net-gas metering.

__Interoperability__: Establishing and maintaining interoperable behavior between Ethereum clients is essential for
developers and end-user adoption, yielding benefits for all participating chains (e.g., ETH and ETC, Ropsten and Morden,
GÃ¶rli and Kotti).

__Immutability__: None of the introduced new opcodes in the EVM has the potential to change the behavior of existing
contracts; in the case where previously an arbitrary invalid bytecode would have been deployed to the network, none of
them would be able to modify the state of the Ethereum Classic networks retrospectively. Adding opcodes to the EVM
increases its functionality and should be considered a feature upgrade rather than a modification.

### Implementation

Adoption of the content of this ECIP requires a hard fork as it introduces changes that are not backward compatible.

The following clients with Ethereum Classic support __implement the _Constaninople_ and _Petersburg_ opcodes__ currently:

- Geth Classic: no support
- Parity Ethereum: all features due to Ethereum Foundation compatibility
- Multi Geth: all features due to Ethereum Foundation compatibility
- Mantis: all features due to Ethereum Foundation compatibility

The following clients with Ethereum Classic support __implement the EIP1702-derived Generalized Account Versioning Scheme__:

- Geth Classic: no support
- Parity Ethereum: no support (?)
- Multi Geth: no support
- Mantis: no support (?)
